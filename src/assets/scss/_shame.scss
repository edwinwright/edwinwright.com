/**
 * Shame Stylesheet
 *
 * The Shame stylesheet is the place reserved just for your hacky code. 
 * The code you have to write to get the release out on time, but the code 
 * that makes you ashamed.
 * 
 * If you have to add a quick hack add it here. It means that other developers 
 * can see what hacks are being introduced, and why; it means that all the 
 * hacky bits of CSS are self contained, and it creates a self-fulfilling 
 * todo list.
 * 
 * How to use this file:
 * 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in Shame
 * 2. Document all hacks fully:
 *   - What part of the codebase does it relate to?
 *   - Why was this needed?
 *   - How does this fix it?
 *   - How might you fix it properly, given more time?
 * 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then 
 *    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
 * 4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time. Even better, 
 *    get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.
